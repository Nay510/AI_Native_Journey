# First, ask the user for their name using the input() function
user_name = input("What's your name? ")

# Store their name in a variable called 'user_name'
# (The line above already does this!)

# Finally, print a personalized greeting using the 'user_name' variable
print("Hello, " + user_name + "! Nice to meet you.")

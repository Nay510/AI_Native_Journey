# This script greets the user, with a special message for a specific name.

print("Hello World!") # A classic start!

# First, we ask the user for their name.
# The input() function waits for the user to type something and press Enter.
user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Define the special name we're looking for.
# Replace "Naomi" with the actual name you want to trigger the special message.
special_name = "Naomi" # <--- IMPORTANT: This is now set to "Naomi"!

# Now, we use an if/else statement to check the entered name.
# If the name matches our 'special_name', a unique greeting is printed.
# Otherwise (else), a standard greeting is printed.
